# Repository contract

Public native Hermes plugin. Keep the runtime generic: hostnames, repositories, channels, personal paths, and secrets belong under the active `HERMES_HOME`, never in this repository.

Naming is fixed by README § *Ubiquitous language*. Reuse those terms in code, JSON keys, persisted state, and wake payloads — or amend that section in the same change.

## Runtime boundaries

- Hermes Cron owns scheduling, the `wakeAgent` script gate, and delivery — one cron job per named heartbeat file.
- The plugin owns collection runtime, deterministic gates, TypeSafe batching, deduplication, and per-heartbeat plugin state (`heartbeat:{name}`).
- Collector implementations live under `$HERMES_HOME/proactive-heartbeats/collectors/`, never in this repository.
- `register(ctx)` only registers surfaces; setup and filesystem writes happen through explicit CLI commands.
- A quiet tick ends with the exact standalone line `{"wakeAgent": false}`.
- Operator config lives under `$HERMES_HOME/proactive-heartbeats/`.
- Deterministic rules resolve without a model; only semantic decisions may reach TypeSafe, batched once per tick. A tick that has nothing to report must cost no model call.

## Quality

Run the commands declared in `.dev/stack.yml`. Tests use the standard library `unittest` runner and assert observable behavior. Lefthook is the local net: ruff on pre-commit, unittest on pre-push. CI is the authority gate: ruff, `compileall`, **`mypy --strict`**, unittest. Modules import each other flat (`from models import ...`) because Hermes puts the checkout root on `sys.path` and `__init__.py` inserts it before importing anything — do not reintroduce `try: from . import x / except ImportError`, it makes the domain types unresolvable and the typecheck vacuous.
